# Hello!! Thank you for reviewing my application assessment.

This app was built using React, and can therefore be run by running npm start/yarn start (after installing modules as needed)

The Robot Avatar links provided from the API were not loading in the browser, so I used one filler image instead.

Thank again,
Randy Steele!
